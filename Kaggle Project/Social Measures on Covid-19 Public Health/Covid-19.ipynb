The two key observations that can be gleaned from the graphs are:\n\n   1.The enforcement of public health and social measures in America has a focus on mask-wearing and school closures. These measures were implemented in late spring 2020 and were maintained throughout the period of examination.\n   2.Despite some short-term fluctuations, restrictions on international travel and public gatherings remained relatively low throughout the period.\n   3.The heatmap indicates a strong correlation between the enforcement severity index and the measures of mask-wearing and school closures.
